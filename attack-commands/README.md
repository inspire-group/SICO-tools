In this folder are two txt files with the exact commands we used to launch the Amsterdam and Seattle interception attacks used in our paper. Do note that topologies and routing policies change so results may differ if the commands are repeated.


Also, because of changes in routing policy and topology, these commands may not achieve interception any more. There are in place as examples of how to use the PEERING testbed.
