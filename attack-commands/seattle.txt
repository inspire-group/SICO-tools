Victim VPN tunnels required: neu01
Victim BGP sessions used: neu01
Victim announcement:
./peering prefix announce -m neu01 IP_PREFIX


Adversary VPN tunnels required: amsterdam01, seattle01
Adversary BGP sessions used: seattle01
Adversary announcement:
./peering prefix announce -m seattle01 -c 65500,3356 -c 65500,174 -c 65000,3356 -c 65000,174 IP_PREFIX

When the adversary announcement is launched against the above victim announcement, the adversary node is able to attract traffic at Seattle and tunnel traffic to the victim via Coloclue in Amsterdam (note the Seattle experiment requires a VPN tunnel to be established to Amsterdam since Seattle only has one transit provider).
